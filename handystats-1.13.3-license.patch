+
+The Source Code called "Handystats" available at https://github.com/shindo/handystats
+ is subject to the terms of the LGPLv3 (hereinafter referred to as the "License").
+ The text of the License is the following:
+
+                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
+
+  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
+  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+
+   This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
+ the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
+ License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
+
+   0. Additional Definitions.
+
+   As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
+ General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
+ General Public License.
+
+   "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
+ other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
+
+   An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
+ by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
+ Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
+ of using an interface provided by the Library.
+
+   A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
+ Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
+ with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
+ Version".
+
+   The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
+ Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
+ for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
+ based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
+
+   The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
+ object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
+ and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
+ Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
+
+   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
+
+   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
+ without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
+
+   2. Conveying Modified Versions.
+
+   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
+ facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
+ that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
+ facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
+ version:
+
+    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
+    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
+    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
+    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
+
+    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
+    this License applicable to that copy.
+
+   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
+
+   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
+ a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
+ code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
+ material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
+ layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
+ (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
+
+    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
+    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
+    covered by this License.
+
+    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
+    document.
+
+   4. Combined Works.
+
+   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
+ taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
+ portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
+ engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
+ the following:
+
+    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
+    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
+    covered by this License.
+
+    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
+    document.
+
+    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
+    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
+    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
+    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
+
+    d) Do one of the following:
+
+        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
+        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
+        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
+        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
+        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
+        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
+        Corresponding Source.
+
+        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
+        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
+        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
+        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
+        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
+        Version.
+
+    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
+    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
+    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
+    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
+    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
+    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
+    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
+    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
+    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
+    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
+    for conveying Corresponding Source.)
+
+   5. Combined Libraries.
+
+   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
+ Library side by side in a single library together with other library
+ facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
+ License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
+ choice, if you do both of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
+    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
+    conveyed under the terms of this License.
+
+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
+    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
+    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
+
+   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
+
+   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
+ of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
+ versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
+ differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
+
+   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
+ Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
+ of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
+ applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
+ conditions either of that published version or of any later version
+ published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
+ received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
+ General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
+ General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
+
+   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
+ whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
+ apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
+ permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
+ Library.
